# Salary-Estimator
- Created a baseline model to predict MAE by predicting set values of 50k, 100k, the mean, 150k and 200k. 
- Demonstrated different ways to reduce model complexity of Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Gradient Boosting while reducing the Mean Absolute Error.
- The best model reduced the MAE to 15.33.

### Motivation
The scenario of my project is a data scientist at a  ficticious company ABC is asked to understand why potential employees are not accepting the offer letters. Your manager knows that it cannot be the location, benefits, etc. because of how stellar they are and that it has to be the salary. 

Obviously, reducing the objective function (mean absolute error) is the desired result. But I wanted to see if I could get similar results without having to use all of the data. If ABC is offering lower salaries, maybe there  is an issue with funding. So I focused on getting the best results but also reducing model complexity to save money on run time.
